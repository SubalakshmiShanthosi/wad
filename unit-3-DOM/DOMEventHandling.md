# DOM Event Handling 

1. Javascript API for DOM

2. Event Handling with the help of DOM tree manipulation

3. DOM for form validation 

4. DOM Manipulation
  
          1.Attribute
      
          2.Style property
      
          3.Removing or Inserting elements
      
          4.Validating correctness of element
      
          5.Navigation of DOM tree
 
 6. Node - Generic object 
      
         1. Document Object
         
         2. Element Object - most often interest 
 
 7. Event 
  
         1. onmouseover
         
         2. onmousehover 
         
         
 8. Events 
      
         1. mouse over
         
         2. mouse out
         
         3. Focus
         
         4. Blur
         
         5. Load and Unload
         
 
 9. Events associated to elements in DOM.

10. Elements trigger events.
 
11. Element object in which event occurs - Target element

12. Function to be called - event handler on triggering on an element

13. Register Event Handler passing Event Object

                  1. Event type
                  2. Event Target
                  3. Event Handler

14. Several ways to add Event Handler 
                
                  1. addEventListener
                            
                             element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
                              
                              useCapture -true capture , false -bubbling
                             
                  2. attachEvent

                             element.attachEvent(event, function);

   
15. Event object 
        
                 1. Event type
                 2. Target element
                 3. Event Listener/Handler
 
 
16.  Event Processing 
               
                To many event handlers to the enclosing parent nodes to the element with another event handler.
                We need to process the events - Event Processing
 
 
17.  Registering several event listener to same element

18.  Order Precedence - Event processing
